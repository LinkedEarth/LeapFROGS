Here's a breakdown:\n\n* Version Control: Git keeps a history of changes made to files, allowing developers to revert to previous versions, collaborate with others, and handle multiple versions of a project.\n* Distributed System: Unlike centralized version control systems, Git allows every developer to have a full copy of the repository, making it robust and ideal for collaborative work.\n* Key Features:\n  * Branching and merging: Developers can work on separate branches and merge changes seamlessly.\n  * Speed and efficiency: Operations like commits, diffs, and merges are fast.\n  * Offline capability: Most tasks can be done without an internet connection.\n\n\n---\n\n# GitHub\n\nGitHub is a web-based platform built on top of Git, providing additional features for collaboration and project management. It allows developers to host and manage Git repositories in the cloud. \n\n* Integration with CI/CD Tools: Automate testing, building, and deployment pipelines.\n* GitHub Pages: Host static websites directly from a repository.\n* Code Hosting: GitHub stores your code in repositories and makes it accessible to collaborators or the public.\n* Collaboration Tools:\n  * Pull requests: Suggest and review code changes.\n  * Issue tracking: Manage bugs, feature requests, and tasks.\n  * Project boards: Organize and prioritize work visually.\n* Social and Community Features:\n  * Forking: Clone repositories to create your version.\n  * Stars: Bookmark repositories you find useful.\n  * Discussions: Communicate and share knowledge within the community.\n\n[Pythia - What is GitHub?](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/github/what-is-github.html)      \n\n[Pythia - What is a GitHub Repository?](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/github/github-repos.html)\n\n---\n\n## Git vs. GitHub\n\n* Git: A tool for version control and code management.\n* GitHub: A platform that uses Git while adding collaboration, hosting, and project management features.\n\nThey are often used together, but GitHub is just one of several services (like GitLab and Bitbucket) that can host Git repositories.\n\n","fields":{"slug":"/chapter5_01_git_and_github"}}},{"node":{"rawMarkdownBody":"\n<div><h1>Author Checklist:<br>Publishing your data</h1></div>\n\n---\n\n<h2> Identify a publicly accessible repository for your data </h2>\n\nThis could be a general, non-curated repository such as Figshare or a curated, domain-specific one such Pangaea or Hydroshare. \n\n<h3>Why is this important? </h3>\n\nSharing your data in publically accessible repository enables other (and yourself) researchers to use your original data for reprocublity and replicability studies or extend your findings. \n\n---\n\n<h2> Fill out the needed metadata, including the license </h2>\n\nMost repositories will guide you through the process, including any specific mandatory fields.  \n\nDon't forget to add a license.

Others are cross-language, but may be dedicated to a scientific domain (e.g., Hydroshare, DesignSafe)\n\n<h3>Why is this important? </h3>\n\nThe registry provides more visibility for your work by adding metadata to your package. In some instances, it makes it easier to install your package. \n\n\n---\n\n<h2> Enable citation of the Software </h2>\n\nThe citation should include a unique persistent identifier for the software. Most software repositories (including GitHub) do not mint DOIs directly. One option is to link your GitHub repository to Zenodo to obtain a DOI for each version of your software upon release. \n\nIn most cases, you will have to provide a citation for your software. To do so, you can use CodeMeta (https://codemeta.github.io/) and the Citation File Format (https://citation-file-format.github.io/). In each case, a plain text file (CITATION.cff) is added to your repository. When you link your GitHub repository with Zenodo, the content of the CITATION.cff file is used to generate the citation in combination with the minted DOI from Zenodo. \n\n<h3>Why is this important? </h3>\n\nCitation helps you get credit for all of your research.

Provide an electronic Notebook. Make sure to indicate any manual steps in the text narrative of the notebook.\n2. Provide a series of scripts. In this case, make sure you have a \"read me\" file that describes in which order to execute and what are the expected output of each script. \nIn both cases, a sketch of the workflow could still be useful and should be shared in the same repository as the executable workflow. There are several options but a popular one is Github, which allows for many developers to work together and has verion control.\n\n<h3>Why is this important? </h3>\n\nSharing your workflow in publically accessible repository enables other (and yourself) researchers to use your original workflow for reprocublity and replicability studies or apply it to other studies. \n\nVersion control allows to easily track changes in the workflow (made by you or other collaborators), and rolls back to a prior stable version if needed or runs continous integration to ensure that introduced changes are still giving proper results.

Five years from now, a particular library could change its default behavior, resulting in differing results.\n\n---\n\n<h2> [Optional] Making your workflow executable</h2>\n\nFor full reproducibility, you may want to consider sharing your workflow in a Docker container or through Binder (e.g., you can use myBinder)\n\n<h3>Why is this important? </h3>\n\nBuilding environment from a list of libraries may become tricky a few years from when the workflow was created. Docker containers make it easier for others to reproduce your work.  \n\n\n---\n\n<h2> Enable citation of the workflow</h2>\n\nThe citation should include a unique persistent identifier for the workflow. If using a sketch publicly available on a general-purpose repository such as Figshare, you will obtain a permanent unique identifier from them.

Issues can be submitted by repository owners/collaborators to track tasks or by outside users with questions/suggestions. \n\n#### Writing a good issue\n\nA bug report should consist of a reproducible example. Some repositories include [issue templates](https://github.com/stevemao/github-issue-templates?tab=readme-ov-file), which generally include space for <em>Expected Behavior</em>, <em>Actual Behavior</em>, <em>Steps to Reproduce the Problem</em>, and <em>Specifications (Version, Platform, Subsystem)</em>. Here's an example of a [well written issue](https://github.com/LinkedEarth/Pyleoclim_util/issues/469). Writing issues in this way makes reproducing problems (or misperceptions of problems) straightforward. This allows for smooth communication with the repository maintainers and greatly improves your chances of resolving your problems.\n\n[More on Issues from project Pythia](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/github/github-issues.html).\n\n### Discussions\n\nGitHub Discussions provide a more open-ended forum for community engagement.

This method is primarily used for making changes to the original repo by users without direct access. This is accomplished by a pull request, which is covered in the next module.\n\n[Clong and Forking from project Pythia](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/github/github-cloning-forking.html)\n","fields":{"slug":"/chapter5_02_intro_github"}}},{"node":{"rawMarkdownBody":"\n<div><h1><img src=\"https://foundations.projectpythia.org/_images/GitHub-logo.png\" alt=\"GitHub Logo\" width=25% align=\"left\"/> Lesson 3<br>Intermediate GitHub</h1></div>\n\n---\n\nNow that you set up your GitHub account, it is time to start collaborating.\n\nLearn about branches, pull requests, and version control systems.\n\n---\n\n## Version control and GitHub releases - an Overview\n\nBefore we delve into the specifics of how version tracking is implemented on the GitHub platform, let's first talk about why we need version control. Version control is essential for scientists because it keeps a detailed history of changes made to files, enabling researchers to track their progress, collaborate effectively, and ensure the reproducibility of their work. It allows multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other’s contributions and provides the ability to revert to earlier versions if mistakes occur. By organizing and preserving every step of the research process, version control ensures transparency and prevents the loss of critical data or code.\n\nOnce in a while, one might want to capture a snapshot of the project. These snapshots are called **releases**. For instance, a release could correspond to the publication of a manuscript. This is actually how you should think about a release: a published paper with version control as the editing process leading up to it. \n\n**Why Should Scientists Care?**\n\n1. Transparency: Share your data, code, and analyses openly.\n2. Collaboration: Allow others to build on your work.\n3. Reproducibility: Ensure your results can be replicated.\n4. Organization: Always have access to past versions.\n\n---\n\n## Version Control in GitHub\n\nVersion control helps track changes to your files over time. It ensures you can:\n\n* Keep a record of every change (what, when, and why it was made).\n* Work collaboratively without overwriting others’ work, using `branches` and by creating `pull requests`.\n* Revert to earlier versions if something goes wrong.\n* Think of it as the “track changes” feature in Word, but for any type of file.\n\n**How does GitHub help with version control?**\n\nGitHub provides a centralized platform to:\n\n* Store your project (called a repository).\n* Track every version and change you make (called `commits`).\n* Share your project with collaborators or the public.\n\nTo learn more about version control and different implementations, read [this article](https://github.com/resources/articles/software-development/what-is-version-control).\n\nA detailed description of version control with git (and how it relates to GitHub) can be found [on the Project Pythia's website](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/github/basic-git.html).\n\n---\n\n## Tips for Scientists Using Version Control\n\n* Always write clear commit messages to explain changes.\n* Use branches for new experiments or major changes.\n* Regularly commit your work to keep track of progress.\n\n---\n\n## What are GitHub releases?\n\nA release is like taking a “snapshot” of your project at a specific point in time.\n* It’s a way to package and share finalized work (e.g., datasets, analyses, or software).\n* You can attach files (like datasets or PDFs) to the release.\n* Releases are versioned (e.g., v1.0, v1.1, v2.0) so others know which is the latest or most stable version.\n\nIt is useful to decide on (1) when to release a new version, and (2) the numbering of the version. Most often, you will see two conventions:\n* x.y.z where x consists of a major release which may result in code breakage as the way the program is called (referred to as an API or application programming interface) is changed (e.g., replacing the name of a parameter); y consists of additional capabilities, and z is used to indicate bug fixes.\n* mm.yyyy which relates to the month and year the software is published. \nIn both of these cases, it is useful to link the GitHub releases to Zenodo releases \n\n---\n\n## Creating a new release on GitHub\n\n1. Navigate to your GitHub repository.\n2. Click Releases > Draft a new release.\n3. Fill out the form:\n    * Tag version: Use semantic versioning as described in the previous slide.\n    * Release title: Provide a descriptive name (e.g., \"Initial Dataset Release\").\n    * Click on `Generate Release Notes` so GitHub automatically populate the description with a history of the versions. \n    * Description: List key changes or features (e.g., \"Includes raw data and analysis scripts for the 2023 project\").\n    * Attach relevant files (e.g., datasets, README.pdf). \n4. Click Publish Release.\n\n---\n\n## Branches\n\nBranches in version control are like parallel workspaces within a project. They allow you to make changes or try out new ideas without affecting the main project (usually called the main or master branch). Each branch starts as a copy of the main project but can be edited independently.\n\n**How to Use Branches**\n1. Experimentation: Use branches to test new methods, analyze datasets, or add features without impacting the stable version of your work.\n2. Collaboration: Team members can work on their own branches, making it easy to merge their contributions later.\n3. Bug Fixes or Updates: Fix an issue or add a new feature in a branch while keeping the main project stable.\nWhen your changes are ready, you can merge the branch back into the main project, ensuring all updates are integrated without disrupting others’ work. Branches help organize work and make collaboration seamless in scientific projects.\n\nAn introduction on how git branches can be found on the [Project Pythia's website](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/github/git-branches.html). The following slide demonstrates how to use branches on the GitHub platform\n\n---\n\n## Creating a Branch on GitHub\n\n<div><img src=\"https://github.com/LinkedEarth/LeapFROGS/blob/main/static/module5/branches.png?raw=true\" alt=\"GitHub branches\" width=25% align=\"left\"/></div>\n\n1. Go to Your Repository\n    * Log in to GitHub and navigate to the repository where you want to create a branch.\n2. Locate the Branch Dropdown\n    * At the top-left of the repository page, you’ll see a dropdown menu with the name of the current branch (e.g., `main` or `master`).\n3. Create a New Branch\n    * Click the dropdown.\n    * In the search bar at the top of the dropdown, type a name for your new branch (e.g., `experiment-1` or `bug-fix`).\n    * Select Create branch: [branch name] from the dropdown.\n4. Switch to the New Branch\n    * Once created, GitHub will automatically switch to your new branch.\n    * You can confirm this by checking the branch name at the top-left of the repository page.\n\n**Pro Tips:** Use clear and descriptive names for branches (e.g., `data-cleaning`, `add-new-figure`, `update-analysis) and regularly merge changes from the main branch into your branch to keep it up to date.\n\n---\n\n## Using the New Branch\nAny changes you make will now be saved to this branch, keeping the main branch unchanged.\n\nYou can edit files directly on GitHub or upload new ones to this branch.\n\n---\n\n## Pull Request\n\nAfter you have forked a repo or created a new branch into your own repository, you are free to fix bugs or add features. After improving the code you can offer your fork as an improved version back to the orginal repo owners (or `main`/`master` branch). This offer is called a `pull request`.\n\n[Pull Requests from project Pythia](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/github/github-pull-request.html)\n\n**Merging Back to the Main Branch**\n1. When your work is complete, go to the `Pull Requests tab` at the top of the repository.\n2. Click `New Pull Request` and select your new branch as the source and `main` as the target.\n3. Review the changes and click `Merge` to integrate your branch into the main project.\n\nA step-by-step tutorial is given in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request). \n\n---\n\n## Make your repository citable\n\nZenodo is most known for data archival. When depositing data with Zenodo, a digital object identifier (DOI) is issued. Creating a persistent reference to the data exactly as they exist at the time of upload and offering an object for citation in scientific publications. Zendo also offers this service for GitHub repositories.\n\n* Open the Zenodo [link](https://zenodo.org/login) and login <strong>with GitHub</strong>.
