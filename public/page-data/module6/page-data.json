This ensures others can see exactly what was done. One of the most effective way to do so is to use electronic notebooks such as Jupyter Notebooks or RMarkDown. If not using these technologies, it is highly recommended to document the steps in a ReadMe file showing which scripts to invoke with the appropriate input and what outputs are expected. Remember that doing science is not simply about whether the code executes but also that it provides the right output. So make sure to describe what is expected (e.g., an increasing trend or a tolerance level less than 10)."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Documentation"}]},{"type":"text","value":": Provide comprehensive metadata, annotations, and instructions for using your workflow, including dependencies, software versions, and any assumptions made during analysis."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Automation"}]},{"type":"text","value":": Use tools like scripts or workflow managers to automate processes, reducing the likelihood of errors and ensuring consistent results.
