<exercise id="1" title="Scientific Python Stack">

The Scientific Python (SciPy) stack consists of fundamental libraries for doing science with Python. Read [this article](https://medium.com/k2-data-science/ds-fundamentals-scipy-stack-dcfc48576f3), which gives you an overview of the core packages. 

Most (if not all) of the scientific libraries that you will be using throughout your career build upon these fundamental libraries, which is why we are giving you an introduction to them in this module.

<exercise id="2" title="Getting Started with Jupyter">

Read the following [article](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/getting-started-jupyter.html) to know more about what Jupyter is.


Then, read this [link](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/jupyterlab.html) to learn particularly about JupyterLab. Follow the exercises on an extra tab/window using the provided [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ProjectPythia/pythia-foundations/main?urlpath=lab/tree/foundations/jupyterlab.ipynb).

We recommend that you install either [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or [Jupyter lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) on your computer for your own scientific needs.
